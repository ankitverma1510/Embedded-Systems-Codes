In this project a washing machine simulator is programmed. There are two ways to operate it, one is by using serial communication and the other one is by using the keys available on the keypad. All the functionalities are done using interrupts except the 4*4 keypad. Polling method is used for 4*4 keypad. The machine is having three cycles which are shown by three different speeds. At the end white led is kept on for showing that the washing is completed. In case abort button is pressed, the whole process will stop and red led will be turned on.
